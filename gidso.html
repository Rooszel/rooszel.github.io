					<h2>Summary</h2>
					<p> As a working student I was a in UX designer and Information analyist. My main my task was to
						redesign part of the Gidso application. A lot of the application was build over years time,
						slowly adding functionalities to it. While no one looked at the usability and design of the
						application. As a first focus, I chose to redesign the search functions within notices and
						dossiers.</p>

					<h2>Context</h2>
					<p>In 2020, an external agency conducted user research. The results had been left unused for two
						years. My task was to review the results and select a project for redesign. I focused on search
						functions in notices and dossiers. Restricting the scope to this area allowed me to
						deliver within the timeframe while improving the integration between the two pages. Before my
						involvement, the pages were cluttered: new features were tacked on without structure, and all
						elements appeared to have the same visual weight, making navigation confusing.</p>
					<h2>Process</h2>
					<p>The external research highlighted several key improvement points:
						Search fields were in the wrong orderâ€”frequently used ones were hidden or buried.
						All information had the same visual weight, reducing clarity.
						Icons in search results were unclear.
						To deepen these findings, I conducted user interviews while also asking consultances about their
						experience working with partens.
						I asked them about specific use cases, this gave me insight from different perspectives while
						staying within the constraints of the
						existing app and database. I then created a project plan, wrote the specifications, and
						developed a wireframe in Adobe XD. After feedback rounds with the product owner and consultant,
						we finalized the design. Due to time and resource limitations, we did not run user tests.
						Finally, I translated the design into development tickets.</p>
					<h2>Final design</h2>
					<p>The final design focused on creating a calmer, more structured page. A single search bar with
						advanced search options was introduced. Within advanced search, results were grouped to improve
						clarity. Because the design is still owned by Topicus I'm not allowed to share any screenshot
						about the design.</p>
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>As my first project in a professional environment, it was challenging at first to have so much
						freedom.
						I managed this by narrowing the scope to search functions and result
						presentation. The professional setting also limited my creative freedom, as the design had to
						fit into the existing application. This constraint was both challenging and a valuable lesson in
						keeping projects clear and practical.</p>
