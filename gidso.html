				<h1>UX designer at Topicus - Gidso</h1>

				<section>
					<h2>Summary</h2>
					<p> In addition to my studies I worked as a UX designer and information analyst. My main my task was
						to
						redesign part of the Gidso application. Gidso is an application developed by Topicus for
						municipalities to streamline incoming notices and dossiers on their social domain cases. <a
							href="https://topicus.nl/en/sectors/social-domain" target="_blank"> More
							information can be found here</a>.
						The application had been developed over multiple years, with features added without considering
						usability and UX design As a first focus, I chose to redesign the search functions within
						notices and
						dossiers.</p>

					<h2>Context</h2>
					<p>In 2020, an external agency conducted user research. The results had been left unused for two
						years. My task was to review the results and select a project for redesign. I focused on search
						functions in notices and dossiers. Narrowing the scope to these functions helped me improve the
						integration between two pages in the application in the desired timeframe. Before my
						involvement, the pages were cluttered: new features were tacked on without structure, and all
						elements appeared to have the same visual weight, making navigation confusing.</p>
					<h2>Process</h2>
					<p>The external research highlighted several key improvement points:
					<ul>
						<li>Search fields were in the wrong orderâ€”frequently used ones were hidden or buried.</li>
						<li>All information had the same visual weight, reducing clarity.</li>
						<li>Icons in search results were unclear.</li>
					</ul>
					I conducted user interviews and approached other stakeholders (consultants) about working with
					partners (different municipalities.).
					I asked them about specific use cases, this gave me insight from different perspectives
					while staying within the constraints of the existing app and database.
					I then created a project plan, wrote the specifications, and
					developed a wireframe in Adobe XD. I worked iteratively with feedback from the product owner and
					consultant.
					Due to time and resource limitations, we did not run user tests, however the plan was written.

					Finally, I translated the design into development tickets.


					</Search>
					</p>
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>The final design focused on creating a calmer, more structured page. A single search bar with
						advanced search options was introduced. Within advanced search, results were grouped to improve
						clarity. Because the design is still owned by Topicus I'm not allowed to share any screenshot
						about the design.</p>
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>As my first project in a professional environment, it was challenging at first to have so much
						freedom.
						I managed this by narrowing the scope to search functions and result
						presentation. There were multiple stakeholders with conflicting opinions, to handle this I made
						a priority list and weigh their opinions based on that. The professional setting limited my
						creative freedom, as the design had to
						fit into the existing application. This constraint was both challenging and a valuable lesson in
						keeping projects clear and practical. </p>
