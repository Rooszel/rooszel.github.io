					<h2>Summary</h2>
					<p>As part of my traineeship, I worked on improving the adoption of the Design Thinking Toolkit
						within the organization. User testing revealed that while people were interested in using the
						toolkit, they struggled to understand when and how to apply it. To address this, I developed a
						new support tool that can be used as a visual aid and an extra explanation if needed.
						It took the form of a board with a island, to help colleagues see Design Thinking as a
						structured, process or a journey rather than a loose collection of activities.</p>
					<h2>Context</h2>
					<p>The Design Thinking Toolkit was created to spread Design Thinking practices across the
						organization. Design Thinking offers a simple, human-centered approach to problem-solving and
						small innovation questions.
						It focusses on user needs and iteration. Using Design Thinking encourages colleagues to take
						ownership of change and innovation, which was a goal for the innovation lab.
						<br> My assignment was to develop the toolkit further and make sure colleagues were able to use
						it.
						However, early user testing showed gaps in adoption: people were unsure about use cases,
						suitable challenges, and how to select methods or steps. So I dediced to focus on inspiring and
						spreading design thinking rather than purely continue development for a tool that lacked
						context.
					</p>
					<h2>Process</h2>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/designthinkinggroot.jpg" alt="" /></span>
					<p>For the process I used the Design Thinking methord and the different phases</p>

					<h4>Empathize</h4>
					<p>The differences between colleagues who embraced experimentation and those who didn’t feel
						empowered to try were identified.
						<br>Learned that many saw Design Thinking as just a set of exercises, not a full process.
						<br> Colleagues lacked context on how to use the toolkit
					</p>
					<h4>Define</h4>
					<p>This phase focused on two central questions:
						<br>How do we make colleagues aware that Design Thinking can be part of their current work?
						<br>How do we communicate Design Thinking as an full process that can be applied to different
						questions and challenges?
					</p>
					<h4>Ideate</h4>
					<p>Multiple group brainstorms were facilitated. The brainstorms generated multipe ideas for both the
						toolkit and how to
						archieve more adoption throughout the organization. </p>

					</p>

					<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/designthinkingfinal.jpg" alt="" /></span>

					<h4>Prototype</h4>
					<p>Different aspects from the brainstorms were made in a paper prototypes. An A/B test was done
						between two different kind of interactions. After the test phase one of them was developed to a
						final prototype.
						Along with a digital version that was made</p>
					<h4>Test</h4>
					<p>The prototype and testing phase were done parallel. One thing was prototype to later be tested.
						The final prototype was tested and with that a final advice was given to the team. </p>

					<h2>Final design</h2>
					<p>
						The Eilandbord helps the Innovation Lab team convoys their message about Design Thinking easier.
						teams
						and their clients plan and visualize Design Thinking phases.
						By laying out steps as a journey across the island, it makes the process feel cohesive and
						concrete. The tool is supported by a facilitator’s guide and can be used independently or during
						workshops.</p>
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This project showed me how important it is to balance tools with mindset. A toolkit alone doesn’t
						do much if no one understands how to use it. So by shifting the focus I made a visual aid that
						helped the original toolkit in its goal.
