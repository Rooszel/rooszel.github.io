					<h2>Summary</h2>
					<p>For my graduation project, I developed an interactive installation for a museum. I worked with
						MuseumFabriek in Enschede, creating an installation about the 2000 fireworks disaster that made
						recorded interviews with those involved accessible and interactive.</p>
					<h2>Context</h2>
					<p>Before my installation, the exhibit consisted of a compilation of five looping videos. Visitors
						could watch them but had no choice in what they saw. My goal was to make the experience
						interactive, allowing visitors to explore what interested them, learn more about specific
						aspects, and understand the relationships between different people involved. Adding
						interactivity made the experience both more engaging and educational.</p>
					<h2>Process</h2>
					<p>
						I began with literature research to define the right framework and requirements. Five key design
						principles emerged:
					<ol>
						<li>The installation must address multiple audiences (e.g., families with children, visitors
							wanting deeper insights).</li>
						<li>It must allow free exploration.</li>
						<li>It must support multiple users simultaneously.</li>
						<li>It must provide added value beyond static displays.</li>
						<li>Language should remain accessible (B1 Dutch level).</li>
					</ol>
					I brainstormed by mapping inputs/outputs and creating word maps. After stakeholder interviews, I
					developed four concepts. The museum chose the concept of an interactive installation using existing
					interviews. We analyzed the interviews, identified a clear timeline and four themes, and designed an
					interface where visitors could choose a theme and time, triggering the corresponding video clip.</p>
					<h2>Final design & testing</h2>
					<p>Final design & testing:
						The interaction flow for visitors was:
					<ol>
						<li>User clicks start.</li>
						<li>User clicks start.</li>
						<li>User views or agrees to information collection.</li>
						<li>User moves a slider on the timeline.</li>
						<li>User selects a category.</li>
						<li>User watches a video and can choose another recommended video or return to the timeline.
						</li>
					</ol>
					We measured user behavior through log data (clicks, usage duration), direct observation,
					questionnaires (based on the Museum Experience Scale), and interviews. The results revealed
					unforeseen design issues, prompting a redesign that is still ongoing.</p>
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Although the project had challenges, including its size and my other commitments such as local
						politics, it was highly educational. I gained hands-on experience with Unity and Figma, and I
						learned how to translate design processes into real-world solutions. Personally, I grew in
						identifying my own pitfalls, managing long-term projects, and working under stress. Going
						through this process, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, taught me to distinguish
						essentials from distractions and strengthened my resilience.</p>
