					<h2>Summary</h2>
					<p>As part of my traineeship, I worked on improving the adoption of the Design Thinking Toolkit
						within the organization. User testing revealed that while people were interested in using the
						toolkit, they struggled to understand when and how to apply it. To address this, I developed a
						new support tool—the Eilandbord (Island Board)—to help employees see Design Thinking as a
						structured, holistic process rather than a loose collection of activities.</p>
					<h2>Context</h2>
					<p>The Design Thinking Toolkit was created to spread Design Thinking practices across the
						organization. Design Thinking offers a simple, human-centered approach to problem-solving,
						focusing on user needs and encouraging employees to take ownership of change and innovation,
						they wouldn’t need the Innovation Lab help anymore.
						<br> However, early user testing showed gaps in adoption: people were unsure about use cases,
						suitable challenges, and how to select methods or steps. For this project, the scope was
						narrowed to early adopters, with the goal of equipping them to inspire others later.
					</p>
					<h2>Process</h2>
					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/designthinkinggroot.jpg" alt="" /></span>

					<h4>Empathize</h4>
					<p>The differences between employees who embraced experimentation and those who didn’t feel
						empowered to try were identified.
						<br>Learned that many saw Design Thinking as just a set of exercises, not a full process.
					</p>
					<h4>Define</h4>
					<p>Focused on two central questions:
						<br>How do we make colleagues aware that Design Thinking can be part of their current work?
						<br>How do we communicate Design Thinking as an integrated, end-to-end process?
					</p>
					<h4>Ideate</h4>
					<p>Facilitated group brainstorms that generated effective ideas for both the toolkit and future
						organizational adoption.</p>

					</p>

					<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/designthinkingfinal.jpg" alt="" /></span>

					<h4>Prototype</h4>
					<p>Different version of a paper prototype that were tested and changed again to a final prototype.
						Along with a digital version that was made</p>
					<h4>Test</h4>
					<p>Different user test done at different stages with different prototypes</p>
					<h4>Advice</h4>
					<p>The main advice that was given was to use the map in conversation as a visual aid. As well as
						continue to make others enthusiatic about Design Thinking in general</p>
					</p>
					<h2>Final design</h2>
					<p>The Eilandbord helps project teams and their clients plan and visualize Design Thinking phases.
						By laying out steps as a journey across the island, it makes the process feel cohesive and
						concrete. The tool is supported by a facilitator’s guide and can be used independently or during
						workshops.</p>
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This project showed me how important it is to balance tools with mindset. A toolkit alone doesn’t
						drive change—people need clarity, confidence, and space to experiment. By translating abstract
						methodology into tangible, visual tools, I learned how to make Design Thinking more approachable
						and actionable for a wide audience.
