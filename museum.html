					<h2>Summary</h2>
					<p>For my graduation project, I developed an interactive installation for a museum. I worked with
						MuseumFabriek in Enschede and created an installation about the 2000 fireworks disaster to
						browsed interviews with involved people.</p>

					<h2>Context</h2>
					<p>Before my installation, the exhibit consisted of a compilation of five looping videos. Visitors
						could watch them but had no choice in what they saw. My goal was to make the experience
						interactive, let visitors explore what interested them, let themlearn more about specific
						aspects, and understand the relationships between different people involved. Adding
						interactivity made the experience both more engaging and educational.</p>
					</p>

					<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/interactionscheme.png" alt="" /></span>

					<h2>Process</h2>

					<p>
						I began with literature research to define the right framework and requirements. Five key design
						principles emerged:
					<ol>
						<li>The installation must address multiple audiences </li>
						<li>It must allow free exploration.</li>
						<li>It must support multiple users simultaneously.</li>
						<li>It must provide added value beyond static displays.</li>
						<li>Language should remain accessible (B1 Dutch level).</li>
					</ol>
					I brainstormed by mapping inputs/outputs and creating word maps. After stakeholder interviews, I
					developed four concepts. The museum chose the concept of an interactive installation using existing
					interviews. We analyzed the interviews, identified a clear timeline and four themes, and designed an
					interface where visitors could choose a theme and time, triggering the corresponding video clip. The
					installation was made with Unity.
					<br>
					After testing the installation in the museum conclusion were made that a lot of the interation was
					unclear. A complete redesign was made so it better guided the user thoughout using the application.
					</p>
					</p>

					<br>

					<h2>Final design</h2>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/afstuderenredesign.png" alt="" /></span>

					<p>Final design:
						The final design was placed in the musuem, it was tested during a 2 month period. Behavior was
						measured through log data (clicks, usage duration), direct observation,
						questionnaires (based on the Museum Experience Scale), and interviews. Those results revealed
						design issues and thus a redesign was made. This redesign makes the options for the user a lot
						clearer and shows a preview of the video they are about to watch. This redesign stayed as a
						wireframe in Figma and isn't developed further.</p>
					</p>
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Although the project had challenges, including its size and my other commitments such as local
						politics, it was highly educational. I gained hands-on experience with Unity and Figma, and I
						learned how to translate design processes into real-world solutions. Personally, I grew in
						identifying my own pitfalls, managing long-term projects, and working under stress. Going
						through this process, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, taught me to stay on the goal and
						not get distracted by unnecessary details.</p>
