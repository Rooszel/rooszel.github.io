					<h2>Summary</h2>
					<p>For my graduation project, I developed an interactive installation for a museum. I worked with
						MuseumFabriek in Enschede and created an installation about the Enschede fireworks disaster to
						browse interviews.</p>

					<h2>Context</h2>
					<p>Initially, the exhibit consisted of a compilation of five looped videos. Visitors
						could watch them but had no choice in what they saw. My goal was to make the experience
						interactive, let visitors explore what interested them, let them learn more about specific
						topics, and understand the relationships between different people involved. Adding
						interactivity made the experience both more engaging and educational.</p>
					</p>

					<h2>Process</h2>
					<p>
						I began with literature research to define the right framework and requirements. Five key design
						principles emerged:
						<div class="div c">	The installation must address multiple audiences  </div>
						<div class="div c">	It must allow free exploration. </div>
						<div class="div c">	It must support multiple users simultaneously. </div>
						<div class="div c">	It must provide added value beyond static displays. </div>
						<div class="div c">	Language should remain accessible (B1 Dutch level). </div>
						
						<br> <br>
					I brainstormed by mapping inputs/outputs and creating word maps. After explorative stakeholder
					interviews, I sketched four concepts that were validated with the stakeholder. The museum chose the
					concept of an interactive installation that uses the interviews displayed in the existing exhibit. I
					analyzed those interviews, identified a clear timeline and four themes, and designed an
					interface where visitors could choose a theme and time, triggering the corresponding video clip. The
					installation was made with Unity.
					<br>
					After testing the installation in the museum, conclusion were made that a lot of the interations
					were
					unclear. A new iteration with significant changes was made so it better guided the user thoughout
					using the application.
					</p>
					</p>



					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/afstuderenredesign.png" alt="" /><caption><sub> The final prototype after the redesign</sub></caption></span>

					<p>	The installation was placed in the musuem, it was tested during a 2 month period. behaviour was
						measured by combining qualitative and quantitative data from log data, direct observation,
						questionnaires (based on the Museum Experience Scale), and interviews. From these results, a new
						iteration was made. This redesign makes the options for the user a lot
						clearer and shows a preview of the video they are about to watch. This redesign stayed as a
						wireframe in Figma and isn't developed further.</p>
					</p>
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Although the project had challenges, including its size and my other commitments such as local
						politics, it was highly educational. I gained hands-on experience with Unity and Figma, and I
						learned how to translate design processes into real-world solutions. Personally, I grew in
						identifying my own pitfalls, managing long-term projects, and working under stress. Going
						through this process, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, taught me to stay on the goal and
						not get distracted by unnecessary details.</p>
